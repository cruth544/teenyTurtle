/**
 *  Moves a CCNode object to a moving target. The moving target can either be a CCNode or a moving position can be provided
 *  by a block. The action can either end, once the target position is reached, or it can be continued infinitely, resulting
 *  in the target of this action following the provided node or position infinitely.
 *
 *  Example for following a node:
 *
 *  @code
 *  CCActionMoveToMovingTarget *moveTo = [CCActionMoveToMovingTarget actionWithSpeed:200.f targetNode:myHero];
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Example for providing a position using a block:
 *
 *  @code
 *  CCActionMoveToMovingTarget *moveTo = [CCActionMoveToMovingTarget actionWithSpeed:200.f positionUpdateBlock:^CGPoint{
 *     return [self calculateSomePosition];
 *  }];
 *  @endcode
